                <p>Put an end to the constant “whys” with a tutor who can answer every one of your child’s questions. What’s a thesis statement? What’s the difference between a subject and predicate?

            <p>Ever wonder “what is an acronym” or “what does an acronym mean”? AITA. BDE. IG. FW. They’re not just letters. They’re acronyms that are all over the Internet. Acronyms can be words formed by the initial letters or groups of letters of words in a set phrase or series of words and pronounced as a separate word. Think NASA or SCUBA or FOMO. Then again, acronyms can be a set of initials representing a name, organization, or the like, with each letter pronounced separately. Think BDE or BBC. So what do all those acronyms mean? We’ve got acronym definitions to help make sense of all those jumbled up strings of letters!</p>
